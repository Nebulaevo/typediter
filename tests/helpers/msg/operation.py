    This utility returns an individual representation of a sample or a list of representation of samples 
    depending on 'is_multiple_operation_values'

    (i) Because some operations are *args operations, sometimes the value is a list of samples
    instead of being a single sample.
    and we want to make each individual sample clear in the failure message.
    (to handle this gracefully, 'formaters.titled_data' accepts lists of strings as well as string)

    Parameters
    ----------
    - **operation_value**
        the sample, or list of samples we want to display in a failure message
    
    - **is_multiple_operation_values**
        bool indicating if the operation value is a sample or a list of samples
        (some individual samples can be lists, or other iterables)
